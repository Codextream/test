## What is it? 

Competitive programming is quite different from other programming paradigms and usually, easier to grasp. You don’t need descriptive variable names or well-documented code. But that does not necessarily mean you code haphazardly because you will have to debug it if it doesn’t work.


The only thing you need to know to begin is a programming language the grader accepts. ACM-ICPC grader accepts C/C++, Java and Python. Almost all graders you’ll encounter will accept these languages (unless if a problem is made for a particular language).


C++ is by far the the most popular language of choice for competitive programmers across the world as it is usually faster than Java and Python, and most of the resources are available in C++. C++ also has a vast library called STL(Standard Template Library) which makes life a lot easier for competitive coders. GNU/G++ is the standard compiler for C++ and C++ 14 is the latest updated version of C++ available on online judges.

## Overview

For CP CLRS can be considered as a good reference book 
for algorithms. Topcoder Tutorials should be read thoroughly and 
the mentioned problems should be solved. Upsolving plays a major 
role for understanding new concepts. Theory for Types and Data Structures,
Algorithms, Programming Languages Fundamentals, Cryptography and Simulations
 and Machine Learning can be read from https://brilliant.org/computer-science/ .
 https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Competitive_Programming has to be followed line 
 by line. Relevant sections from https://github.com/wncc/CodeInQuarantine/tree/master/Week_2_CC 
 can (read must) also be covered.
 
 https://towardsdatascience.com/intro-to-data-science-531079c38b22 provides a nice 
 introduction to data science. https://towardsdatascience.com/ is a really nice webite 
 to quench your thirst for data science. Once you have explored this field fair enough, 
 you can start with R or Python. But according to me you must first explore which field 
 are you really made for.
